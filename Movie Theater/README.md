# Movie Theater
This database was created for two seperate class projects (Database Design and SQL Implimentaion).
These projects involved a design phase as well as a query phase.

Data entry and design where the bulk of time invested.
MySQL modeling, importing, and exporting were used to faciliate creation, while SSMS and MySQL were used for queries.
For both projects, a partner was responsible for half of the SQL queries.
