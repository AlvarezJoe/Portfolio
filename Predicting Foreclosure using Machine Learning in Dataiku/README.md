# Simple Modeling and Analysis in Dataiku
This word document provides a summation of modeling done in the Dataiku environment for an AI Thinking course in Miami Dade College.

The processes done to arrive at these models consisted of a cleaning and transformation stage, an exploratory data analysis stage, and an overall quick modeling stage. After those stages were conducted a deeper modeling stage was created and implemented for which this document pertains to.

The model was created using the entire dataset (due to the size of the overall dataset being small) and 10 k-fold validation was used.
