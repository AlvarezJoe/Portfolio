# Multiple Linear Regression in R
This notebook was created in a programming R for statistics course from Miami Dade College's Data Analytics program to demonstrate the use of multiple linear regression by predicting salary within the hitters dataset. 

Alongside the model, there is questions provided by an instructor to determine whether the students has a proper understanding of the model's statistical and practical significance as well as testing to determine the models validity.

The dataset used (Hitters) is provided by the ISLR package. The leaps package is utilized to determine the best subset within the multiple linear regression model.
