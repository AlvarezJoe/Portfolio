This data was sourced from:  https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

Unfortunately, this dataset lacks sufficient information (scores, viewcount...) that would have made this a much more interesting project.

For the most part this project involved a bit of data exploration, cleaning, and visualizations on SSMS and Tableau.

I'll be linking the visualization on Tableau Public.
