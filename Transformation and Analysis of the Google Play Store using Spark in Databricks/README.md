# Transformation and Analysis of Google Play Store using Spark in Databricks
This notebook and dashboard were created to transform, analyze, and present information about the Google Play dataset. This project was created and presented in a big data course in Miami Dade College.

The dataset used was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapive/google-play-apps-and-games

This dataset contained over 3.4 million records and 36 columns. The data was loaded directly into the databricks environment, and pyspark/pandas were utilized to transform the data.

While both my partner and I expressed an interest to provide structured streaming as part of our project, a lack of resources on the part of the community edition of databricks caused us to opt out of doing so.
