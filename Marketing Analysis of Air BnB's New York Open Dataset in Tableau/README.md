# Marketing Analysis of Air Bnb's New York Open Dataset
This was a project for Data Visualization.

The dataset was cleaned in excel. Notes on how the dataset was cleaned are included.

From there the idea of a marketing campaign was devised. The lack of customer records caused us to take a unique approach towards finding the most succesful neighborhoods to promote within the marketing campaign.
