# Portfolio
This Portfolio consists of SQL, Tableau, R, Python, C++, Spark, and Dataiku. 
The topics covered within it are general programming, data science, machine learning, data analytics, exploratory data analysis, and database administration. 

The work consists of projects done with Miami-Dade College's data analytics program and personal projects to display my skills.

These projects are a small sample of the amount of work done throughout my professional career. As such, this means that there are many skills that I have not covered in this portfolio.
