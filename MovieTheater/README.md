# Movie Theater
This database was created for two seperate class projects.
These projects involved a design phase as well as a query phase.

Data entry and design where the bulk of time invested.
MySQL modeling, importing, and exporting were used to faciliate creation, while SSMS and MySQL were used for queries.
