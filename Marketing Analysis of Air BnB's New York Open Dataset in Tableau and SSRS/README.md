# Marketing Analysis of Air Bnb's New York Open Dataset
This was a project utilizing Tableau in Miami Dade College's Data Analytics program to demonstrate data visualization, and was then adopted for the use of report/dashboard creation using SSRS.

Both projects were produced via team collaboration, but for the SSRS project the creation of the tables, matrixes, database and all associated queries invloving DDL and DML were created by me.

The dataset was cleaned in excel. Notes on how the dataset was cleaned are included.

From there the idea of a marketing campaign was devised. The lack of customer records caused us to take a unique approach towards finding the most successfull neighborhoods to promote within the marketing campaign.
